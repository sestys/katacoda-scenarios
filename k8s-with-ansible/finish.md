### You have finished the tutorial where you have learned how to:
- initiate and create a __K8s__ cluster using __Minicube__,
- get information about the cluster,
- set up __Ansible__
- set up an inventory file with hosts divided into groups
- create a simple playbook and execute on remote host,
- create a more advanced playbook to initiate k8s namespace and deploy docker images to it.

As more development and deployments move to the cloud, it's important to understand how to automate the important aspects of your cloud. Ansible offer many more modules (AWS, GCP, Azure, MongoDB, ...) and tools (roles, templates, and more) to help you automate routine tasks and makes your job easier. Check out more about it [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html).

Congrats! You have taken the first step towards learning how to automate Kubernetes with Ansible!

### GOOD JOB!
